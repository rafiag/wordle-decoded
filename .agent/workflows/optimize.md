description: Review and optimize the code in the active file
---

1. **Complexity Analysis**: Analyze the time complexity (Big O) of the functions within the active file.
2. **identify Bottlenecks**: Identify any nested loops, inefficient data structures, or redundant operations that can be optimized or flattened.
3. **Refactor**: Rewrite the code to improve performance while maintaining the original functionality and adhering to the project's engineering standards.
4. **Validation**: Ensure that the refactored code passes all existing tests.
5. **Report**: 
    - Provide the refactored code.
    - Explain the specific optimizations made.
    - Compare the original and new time/space complexity to demonstrate why it is faster.
